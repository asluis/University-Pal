# University-Pal
University Pal is a project made to help students buy textbooks from each other at reduced prices. Instead of posting books on social media hoping for someone to buy them, students can use UniPal to help them sell their books to other students. Also, UniPal can help students buy used textbooks at a discount.
## Why was UniPal Created?
At the beginning and end of every semester, students are looking to either buy or sell textbooks. This leads to students searching multiple platforms for a place to sell their old books or buy used books. It is not uncommon for students to sell their used books to companies at a considerable discount and for other students to buy those same books at a markup. 
## Technologies Used
This project was made entirely in Swift. It used SwiftUI as the frontend framework and Firebase as the app's database. It also took advantage of the sign-in and log-in features that Firebase provides.
